C++ operators

1.Arithmetic Operators (ADD (+) ,SUB (-) ,MUL (*) ,DIV (/) ,MOD (%) ,INCREMENT (++) ,DECREMENT (--))

2.Assignment Operators (= , += ,-= ,*= ,/=)

3.Relational Operators (TRUE(1) OR FALSE(0) : == ,!= ,> ,>= ,< ,<= )

4.Logical Operators (&& ,|| , !)

5.Bitwise Operators
6.Other Operators

1.ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
   *ADD (+): Used to add the values.
   *SUB (-): Used to subtract the values.
   *Mul (/): Used to check the Quotient values.
   *MOD (%): Used to check the Remainder values;

   *INCREMENT (++): Used to Increase the value of operand by 1.
     1.PRE INCREMENT (++a);
     2.POST INCREMENT (--a);

   *DECREMENT (--): Used to Decrease the value of operand by 1.
     1.PRE DECREMENT (--a);
     2.POST DECREMENT (a--); 


 2.ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
    *Assignment	(=): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
    *Add and Assignment	(+=): Add the value and assign to left variable . (EX: a += b : means first add the values(a+b) then assign to left (a=values)).
    *Subtract and Assignment (-=)
    *Multiply and Assignment (*=)
    *Divide and Assignment (/=)


3.RELATIONAL OPERATORS:
*Is Equal To (==):	Checks both operands are equal.
*Greater Than (>):	Checks first operand is greater than the second operand.
*Greater Than or Equal To (> =): Checks first operand is greater than equal to the second operand.
*Less Than (<): Checks first operand is lesser than the second operand.
*Less Than or Equal To (<=): Checks first operand is lesser than equal to the second operand.
*Not Equal To (!=) Checks both operands are not equal.


4.LOGICAL OPERATORS:
*Logical AND (&&): Returns true only if all the operands are true or non-zero.
*Logical OR	(||): Returns true if either of the operands is true or non-zero.
*Logical NOT (!): Returns true if the operand is false or zero.


5.BITWISE OPERATORS:  //Only char and int data types can be used with Bitwise Operators//
*Binary AND	(&): Copies a bit to the evaluated result if it exists in both operands.
*Binary OR	(|): Copies a bit to the evaluated result if it exists in any of the operand
*Binary XOR(^):	Copies the bit to the evaluated result if it is present in either of the operands but not both
*Left Shift	(<<): Shifts the value to left by the number of bits specified by the right operand
*Right Shift (>>): Shifts the value to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
*Oneâ€™s Complement (~): Changes binary digits 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
